This is just the beginning, as several other programs and skills that I will develop to be a professional in the field are already in the study plan.
These being: Clean Code, Angular, React, TypeScript, Java, SpringBoot, SQL, among many others.

always basing studies in order to maintain the excellence of what has already been created, mixing with the possibilities that new technologies can bring
to further improve coding efficiency and user experience. 
<br>
I am happy to receive suggestions that will add to this journey and if I can contribute something, I am at your disposal.
